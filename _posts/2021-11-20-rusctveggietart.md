## rustc veggies tart (claimed ownership)

Do not perform any borrowing; I am sure you can bake this tart on your own!

### Ingredients

* 1 cup white flour 
* 1 cup brown flour 
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tbsp flax seeds
* 1/2 cup olive oil
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 grated Parmesan cheese
* 150g Swiss cheese, or Emmental cheese (other types\[ 1 \] of cheese may also work in the unification algorithm)
* 1 onion
* 3 large carrots
* 3-4 Zucchini
* 1 can Heart of Palm (optional but I like it; this item may be hard to find)
* Spinach
* Parsley
* Pepper
* Salt

Axiom: 1 cup is equivalent to 250ml, or any container that can hold up 250ml of a liquid.

### Preparation

In a large bowl, add the two types of flour, 1 tsp salt, the flax seeds, the olive oil and the water. Mix it until it becomes an uniform dough. You'll notice it'll be very oily - that is the goal. If your bowl has a lid, close it and take it to the fridge while you prep the other modules of this reciPL. (For a less environmentally friendly implementation, wrap the dough with plastic wrap).

Chop the onion into cubes; add olive oil in a frying pan; medium heat; add the onion. Wait a few minutes; add spinach to the pan with chopped onion; add salt and pepper; let the spinach release its water for 2-3 min. Turn off the heal; let it cool down.

It's time to increase the lifetime of your arms - there is a lot of grating to be done.

Grate the carrots. Grate the zucchini. Grate the Parmesan cheese. If you are going for hearts of palm, chop them in small disks. Chop the Swiss cheese (or Emmental cheese) in small cubes.

Now it's a good time to preheat your oven to 200C.

In a large bowl, add the carrots, zucchini (and Maybe Some(heartOfPalm)). Salt, pepper and parsley. Add the spinach-onion mix (it should be cool by now). Mix them all. Add the eggs, add 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese that you have (equiv to 1/4 cup), and add the Swiss or Emmental cheese cubes. Mix everything again.

Take the dough out of the fridge (remove the plastic wrap if any). To save time, you can roll it directly in a baking tray (i.e. a cookie baking tray). Place the dough in the baking tray, sprinkle a bit of flour on it, use a rolling pin to flatten the dough. It should not be too thin! 1.5cm should do the job. Pour the veggie mix in the center of the flattened dough; quickly fold the borders inwards to create a closed tart surface. It will be very rustc, and that is what we want!

Place the baking tray in the oven for 50min-1hr.

Enjoy your rustc tart, and perform sharing with moderation! This reciPL is so good and easy to do that you might not want to have shared references.




### Useful hints

\[ 1 \] You can replace the cheese types; avoid choosing too soft or too oily types of cheese, because this reciPL is already too oily.

You can make it a non-vegetarian reciPL by adding turkey, ham or chicken to it.

And, of course, you can play with the veggies choice as you like. I suggest keeping the carrots; they give consistency to the inner module of the tart.

If you remove the spinach, the tart gets good in the fridge for 3-4 days!
